MO#

Employee number
Department {paint, conventional}

CrewSize (PPH multiplier only)

on disk job storage

configurable port

operation numbers need to store predicted parts completed vs actual

MO#'s are not reused
each MO# has a few unique operation#'s
PPH and department never change for a given operation number

enter new/existing MO#:

 -> MO page, shows operations, Departments, PPH, parts completed "Work" link,

    -> work page has Employee number, crew size, start/stop timer, log part

are department numbers tied to MO# or operation#?
What fields need to be searchable?
What do you want to do with employee number?
should crew size/ individual work sessions be stored?
